Introduction
============

ERGWAVE Autologin is an android application for automatically logging into the ERGWAVE network upon connect. It is activated by the android system every time it connects to a WiFi network. If the network's SSID is "ERGWAVE", the application will proceed to automatically login to the network. Upon success, the user will be notified by a "Toast" notification. Upon failure, the user will be notified by an status-bar notification from which the user can check the error message.

1. Install the application.
2. Open the application to configure your username and password.
3. Connect to ERGWAVE. (Reconnect if you are already connected.)
