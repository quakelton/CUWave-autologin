Why not use Wi-Fi?!\r\n\r\n### 1 - One Click Connect\r\nTired of the loop of connect - browse a random non-HTTPS page - ignore the warning and login steps before using Wi-Fi in CUHK? By using this app, you will always be connected one step ahead your coursemates.\r\n\r\n### 2 - Security\r\nWe cross-check the HTTPS certificates of login servers with known-good ones to authenticate official servers, to make sure your passwords will not be passed to forged hotspots. All your account information is passed directly to the CU Wi-Fi login servers. Your information is only sent to the official Wi-Fi login servers, and you can verify this!\r\n\r\n### 3 - Open Source\r\nSource code of CUWave is free and open! You can modify it and audit the code as you want.\r\n\r\n### CUWave x ERG users\r\nCUWave supports connection to ERGWAVE!\r\n\r\n### App Compatibility\r\nCUWave currently supports Android 5.0+ devices. We are working hard to lower the requirements of CUWave. Stay tuned!\r\nSupported SSIDs: CUHK / CUHKa / ERGWAVE / ERGWAVE_5g\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCUWave is a fork of [MU-Wifi](https://github.com/pawitp/muwifi-autologin) by pawitp @ MUICT9. CUWave includes code snippet from (http://yeory.com/126). Modifications are made by [Elton Chung](https://github.com/quakelton) to fit for usage in CUHK.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCUWave is not an official app, it is provided as-is, meaning no warranty is guaranteed.
